# Rapid-Flood-Inundation-Mapping-using-GEE
In many parts of South Asia, floods are a frequent occurrence. Effective flood management requires precise and timely flood mapping methodologies to adopt disaster risk reduction strategies and enable efficient response efforts.  This GEE code will help you understand how efficiently you can generate a flood inundation map within a few minutes.

I've included a few reference papers for you that use this code.
